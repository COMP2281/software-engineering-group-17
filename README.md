## Questions to ask client

1. What platform should the game work on? (OS dependent? Windows/Linux/IOS/Android/Web-based?)
2. How in-depth should the resources linked in the game go into? (If an end user can get the badges in the IBM courses, should they be made to play the game fully, or can they answer the question and quickly get through it?) - Should the game’s sole focus be to help the player answer IBM’s SkillBuild courses, or should the game be enjoyable as well?

## Ideas 

### Inspiration - Undertale / Deltarune

- The player is an IBM employee and gets transported to a world in his computer
- Everything from his job appears in the world
- His computer is corrupted and needs fixing (he also wants to go back home)
- Make a top down 2D rpg
- Doors block the way forward, players must answer questions to proceed
- Players can find answers to questions through combat and puzzles
- Combat will have the option to “scan enemies” for information to get clues on how to answer questions
- Have puzzles where the layout is basically trying to mix and match items. Can also include Q&A
