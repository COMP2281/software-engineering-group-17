## 1 - Introduction

### 1.1 - Overview and Justification

This document is the Requirement Specification for our RPG IBM Skills Build project. There are three parts to this document. The first part is the introduction, which gives a high-level description of the project, and its scope. The second part, the Soultion Requirments, is the main part of the requirement specification. This part specifies the projects functional and non-functional requirements, and assess the risks which may occur when undertaking the project. The third part describes our approach to the development of the game, as well as our time schedule in order to complete the project within the agreed deadline.

Our client is IBM, and our contact at IBM is Mr John McNamara. We have been tasked to build an RPG game. This RPG game must facilitate the gaining of IBM Skills Build badges, and therefore must encourage the player to aquire the skills nessesary to complete each course in order to be awarded the appropriate badge. The game should achieve this by being fun and engaging experience for the player. However, the game does not need to teach the course content, but can refer to the courses from which the IBM Skills Build badges are obtained. This game is aimed to appeal to high school and university students, and hence should be accessible to people with little or no knowledge of Computer Science.
