### Introduction (25%) [2 minutes]

#### Introduction of client [20s]

- Our client is IBM, and the company contact is John McNamara

>     Slide with IBM Logo and Jon's picture

#### Summary of agreed deliverables from req spec [40s]


- Make an RPG game that 're-imagine IBM Skills Build' with resources linked in-game, helping students navigate Skills Build and get badges from topics successfully
- After acquiring a badge, students are rewarded with in-game items reflecting their growth 
- The game must be made using Unity and for Windows machines.

>     Slide with Project Brief and emails from Jon

#### Introduce our project goals and aims [60s]

- Make a top-down 2D puzzle RPG. 
- The game features a multitude of areas, whose themes and puzzles are adapted from specific Skills Build courses and their respective test questions. To solve these puzzles, students are expected to go through the Skills Build course of that area
- The game features knowledge battles with bosses found at the end of each area. Students who can beat the bosses are armed with the knowledge to get a Skills Build badge. Beating a boss unlocks powerups
-  The game's sprites for important aspects like bosses and player character will be handmade, and the rest will be from sprite packs online

### Technical Outline (45%) [6 minutes]

#### Description of technical design

- Not sure

#### Walkthrough of features and ideas

- For each of the following, also talk about the alternative options briefly:
  - Character sprites inspired by Pokemon games for their 2.5D models
  - Combat inspired by Phoenix Wright since it fits with the idea of knowledge battles
  - Questions through combat (multiple choice) and puzzles (more discreet multiple choice)
  - Combat menu inspired by Final Fantasy for its ease of use and dynamic display
  - Health system based on Minecraft for simplified combat, and designed like Hollow Knight because its pretty

>     Slides with original sections from market research next to our choice

#### Development approach

- No idea lmao James help

>     Slides with the development approach (agile, scrum)

#### Flow diagrams of user experience

- Quick walkthrough of the game states
- Showing what the sprites might look like for the user

>     Slide with game flow diagram and some sprites from market research

#### Limitiations/problems

- A student who knows all the content can quickly blitz through the game without accessing Skills Build
- Students can brute force an answer for the puzzles. This is less of a problem with boss fights as you need to get lots of answers right in a row
- The game cannot detect if a student struggles, and does not offer anyway to help them besides directing them to the Skills Build course page or give vague advice

>     Slide showing the flash, hammering a lock, and a student confused
