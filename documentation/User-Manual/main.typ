= Project introduction

[TODO] Recap briefly the client request
- Issue with IBM Skills Build
- What John wants us to make (a game), and how this will help solve the issues

= Solution discussion

[TODO] Provide analysis of Project Brief + John Email
- Show project brief and John's email
- Split and analyse project description section in the word docs
- Say we currently implemented RPG game with IBM questions linked from badge topics, and have implemented fully AI, DS, and partially Cloud/Threat

[TODO] Discuss impact our project has currently, and might have in the future
- Currently, a game that can be played alongside doing IBM badges
- Helps navigate Skills Build website
- In the future, perhaps permanently implemented as one of IBM Skills Build's official game
- Can make learning more fun, helps students remember more, especially if project is adapted to:
  - Include more worlds based on badges
  - Link the learning more directly into the game instead of Q&A
  - Have personal tile maps and assets made instead of publicly online ones

= Initial ideas and current integration

[TODO] Explain our ideas that we brainstormed from way before at the beginning of the project
- Use the project idea and market research extensively as a reference point
- In fact, since market research wasn't part of any coursework related stuff, just bring the entire thing into this user manual lmao. I wont make more sections besides 3.1 since this might as well be the plan

== Market Research

Role Playing Games [add to glossary] (RPGs) are a genre of video game that has been continuously iterated upon since the 1970s @first-rpg, as such before starting development on our game, we decided to do market research into some pre-existing RPG titles, alongside some other games we felt were relevant to our game.

This market research can be broken down into 4 categories:
- Combat
- Menus
- Sprites
- Health

-- Others: Hub world

=== Combat
RPG combat has incredible variation, and there is far from one set presentation or style that must be followed for an RPG game, thus we need to decide on what format we want the question and answer (Q&A) combat to be in, firstly in how we want our player and our enemies to be represented in battle.

[Talk about the fact that they're all turn based maybe]

==== Undertale
One of the first RPGs that come to mind when we consider combat encounters that allow you to talk to your enemies is the 2015 game Undertale, which does not feature the player character, and has a front shot of the enemy you are fighting or talking to.

#figure(
  image("Images/battle1.png", width: 100%),
)

==== Final Fantasy VI
Alongside the likes of Dragon Quest, the Final Fantasy series is one of the forefathers of the RPG genre; Final Fantasy VI is the last 2D mainline Final Fantasy game, the game features combat where players and enemies face each other from opposite sides of the screen, with sprites that show their full bodies.

#figure(
  image("Images/battle2.png", width: 100%),
)

==== Pokemon
As the highest grossing media franchise in the world@franchises, the original Pokemon games have captivated many people over the years, featuring two characters facing off on opposite corners, both with a 3/4 perspective sprite, with the player character facing away from the camera.

#figure(
  image("Images/battle3.png", width: 100%),
)

==== Ace Attorney Investigations
While not an RPG series, the Ace Attorney games are puzzle games, where the main "combat" encounters take place with a courtroom, featuring the attorney and prosecutor in a battle of wits. In the mainline games these characters take up a full screen to themselves, however, the spinoff Ace Attorney Investigations features the two characters on one screen, duking with their words. Considering the dynamic experessions and how it requires you to "talk to fight", I thought this would be a good fit for the style of game we are making.

#figure(
  image("Images/battle4.png", width: 100%),
)

==== Fear and Hunger
As a relatively unknown RPGMaker [maybe talk about what rpgmaker is] Horror game, Fear and Hunger features gruelling and cruel combat encounters, many of which encounters you can talk to the enemy to try and distract them, find out information or damage their mind by answering their questions. This game features front on enemies, similar to Undertale, while the player characters you see from the back in 3/4 perspective, like with Pokemon.

#figure(
  image("Images/battle5.png", width: 100%),
)

==== Mario and Luigi RPG
The Mario and Luigi RPG games differ from regular RPGs, as while they are still predominantly turn based, it also involves timing button inputs to do additional damage, or avoid enemy attacks. This makes very a particularly engaging combat system that requires both strategy and skill. The games displayed below are Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story and Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door.

#figure(
  image("Images/battle6.jpg", width: 100%),
)
MAKE THE ABOVE IMAGE FIT THE STYLE + INCLUDE TTYD

=== Menu
We also need to consider how the player will answer questions, and what type of menu we want the player to use.

==== List Style
This is arguably the most popular style of menu in RPG games, and involves a scrollable list, to which players will move down the list, relatively simple to implement and does what it needs to.

#figure(
  image("Images/menu1.png", width: 100%),
)

==== Square Style
Having a square menu style with 4 options is less popular in the genre, but is still featured in the monolithic franchise Pokemon, this style may work quite well for Q&A style combat, however is slightly more difficult to implement however, and limits us to 4 answers.

#figure(
  image("Images/menu2.png", width: 100%),
)

=== Sprites
While combat sprites depend on the combat style we choose, all of the characters in the game need to have consistent sprites in the overworld, and so we looked into the different sprite sheets used in various other RPG games, both from a complexity standpoint, due to our limited knowledge of art, and stylistic standpoint

One of the biggest things to consider with sprite sheets is the amount of space they take up relative to the world around them, traditional RPG style has the world split into "tiles", which can be thought of like a square grid, in which the characters normally move between these tiles, and normally mean that sprites have to fit into that square area. However newer top-down 2D games are less restrictive, and have more free movement, which also means that character sprites do not have to conform to set tile space

The sprites I am showing off in this section are all walking animation sprites, with a step-stand-step style of animation, which is simple to animate, but works brilliantly, and is still used in modern top down games today.

#figure(
  image("Images/spritesheet.png", width: 100%),
)

==== Final Fantasy VI
Final Fantasy 6 sprites differ from the rest as they only have 2 frames on their sideways walk, they are slightly taller than a single tile, but would work for a tile-based game, and are relatively simple. And considering the person doing the art for our group does not have a great deal of experience, simple sprites are probably better.

==== Fear and Hunger
Fear and Hunger sprites are 2 tiles tall, this means that while their hitbox is in their lower half, they also have an upper half, which lets them appear much more human and realistic. These sprites are much more complicated, but look amazing because of it.

==== Stardew Valley
Stardew Valley's sprites do not conform to the tile system, but character designs are still simple, yet appear move humanlike by not conforming to tiles.

==== Pokemon
Pokemon games are the classic representation of tile-based sprite sheets, and while simple and stylised, they also carry alot of detail.

==== RPGMaker
RPGMaker is a game engine inspired by classic RPG games, and thus operate off a tile system, with their example sprites all fitting into one tile.

==== Simple
Finally, we have the super simple 16x16 sprites, which conform to tiles, but lack a lot of detail.

==== Faith: Unholy Trinity
Faith: Unholy Trinity sprites were purposfully created to be as simple as possible to emulate old 90s game sprites, thus they use limited colours and no shading, but are visable enough to make out what the sprites are.

==== Party Hard
Party Hard Sprites are similar to the Faith sprites, in that they are very minimalistic, but express enough detail to be identifiable.

==== Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga
The Mario and Luigi sprites are iconic for the Game Boy Advanced era. As the hardware was not very bright due to the screens limitations, the work around to make the characters seem more eye-catching and visible was to give them a thick black outline. This made the characters pop out more from the background scenery and became a staple for the series even after the hardware limitations were fixed.

[TODO] Clean up text, maybe split up sprite sheets/ combine final ones

=== Health
We need to be able to keep track of how many questions have been answered correctly and there are several ways to do this, however keeping in line with RPG games, the best way is through Hit Points (HP), these normally represent how much damage the player has taken [CHECK DEFINITION]. Converting this to Q&A style combat, we can say that if the player answers a question correctly, the enemy takes damage, and if you answer a question wrong, the player character takes damage.

There are multiple ways of representing HP, however we will be deciding between health bars and heart bars.

==== Health Bars
A health bar is quite simply a bar to display health, normally analogue in nature.
Take this screenshot from Guilty Gear Xrd, a fighting game released in 2014. At the top of the screen there are two health bars to represent each character's health.

#figure(
  image("Images/GGX1.jpg", width: 100%),
)

As this health bar depletes it will "empty" towards the centre of the screen.

#figure(
  image("Images/GGX2.jpg", width: 100%),
)

Or take this screenshot from Trails from Zero, an RPG originally released in 2010, which features 4 "party members" each of which having 3 bars, "Health Points", "Energy Points" and "Craft Points", each of which deplete towards the left as you use them or are damaged. In addition, if you bring your Craft Points over 100, there is another bar, in a lighter colour of green, that overlaps the original bar, which is commonly used in games to represent a strong character having multiple health bars.

#figure(
  image("Images/TrailsZero.jpg", width: 100%),
)

The advantages of health bars is that they simple and easy to look at, as they can be represented numerically, and thus can be manipulated freely.

==== Heart Bars

Heart bars are a more discrete representation of health bars, as instead of having a large number to represent health, you instead have a more constant smaller numerical representation, and each piece of damage would represent one "heart".

In Minecraft you have 10 hearts, where each piece of damage counts for a quarter of a heart, thus giving a visual representation of 40 hit points.

#figure(
  image("Images/minecraft.png", width: 100%),
)

In addition, if you have the "absorption" effect, you get bonus hearts, which overlay the regular hearts, represented by their yellow colour.

#figure(
  image("Images/minecraftYellow.png", width: 100%),
)

The positives of heart bars are they also allow you to represent health in unique ways, for example in hollow knight, each piece of health is represented by a "mask", thus this concept allows for more creativity, as we can represent health as whichever item we desire, however this would require a lot more programming and asset creation.

#figure(
  image("Images/mask.jpg", width: 80%),
)



[TODO] Explain why our game is designed like Undertale/Deltarune
- Top down 2D RPG
- Lots of puzzles as well as combat
- Simple but effective

[TODO] Explain hub world and concepts of worlds
- Wrath of cortex
- Modularity, can easily add and remove things in parallel, without disrupting ongoing works
- Fits well into user req

== Current Implementation

From the above market rearch we decided to model the combat on Ace Attorney Investigations, with 2 big sprites of the characters on each side, the menu used will be list style and the character sprites will be modeled on pokemon characters, and the health system will be based on hearts.

We took futher inspiration from Undertale 

& Hub world explanation

=== Overworld Sprites

=== Combat Sprites

=== Menu Sprites


= Game instruction manual

The structure of the game instruction manual is inspired by a manual from a Nintendo title called "Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity" @Pokemon-MD-manual. 

== Getting started

[TODO] FOR EACH SECTION, LINK TO THE CORRESPONDING FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

=== Introduction
[TODO] Add images of the 4 worlds, a puzzle, a boss fight and IBM question (the room w the 4 option buttons)

Our game's story begins with the player, an IBM employee doing work in his office like any other day, when they are suddenly sucked into their computer and transported to the world of the IBM Tower of Skills Build Mastery. Dazed and confused, the player wakes up in the Hub world and decides to explore their new surroundings when suddenly, they are beckoned to an altar by an unknown voice. When arriving at the altar, they are greeted by the spirit of the altar, a helper character giving the player insight on where they are and what they must do to leave. The IBM Tower of Skills Build Mastery is a world that exists between time and space and needs to disappear in order for the real world to continue functioning. Destroying the world is also the only way for the player to go back home, so they agree to help the spirit in destroying it. The altar instructs the player to find 4 relics of alternate worlds and bring them back to the altar. Only then can they reach the creator of the world and defeat him to destroy the world. Armed with this knowledge, the player embarked on a journey through each of the worlds, solving puzzles, playing mini-games, answering questions from Skills Build to progress and fighting battles of whits against corrupted IBM co-workers who have also been trapped in the Tower of Skills Build Mastery.

Will you succeed in saving them and returning to your world?

#figure(
  image("Images/Sighing.png", width: 50%),
  caption: [Image of ... sprite when answering a question wrong during combat.],
)

Each World the player can enter will represent a Skills Build course, with questions in the world coresponding to that course. Boss fights in each world will also invlove these question, with combat being a knowledge based fight, in which the player must answer Skills Build question correctly  to defeat the enemy.

The game will also feature a skill tree, in which the player can choose different status upgrades when defeating a boss in combat, making subsequent boss fights easier.

=== Main menu

[TODO] Link with FRs

[TODO] UPDATE IMAGES

[TODO] Restructure the next sections to lead into each other? Like moving control to be after worlds?

The Main menu is an inviting location for new players, with sombre music and a futuristic background image with the IBM logo in it. Furthermore, to give the main menu more liveliness, the background image moves around at random intervals in time, and blur and unblur itself too.

Now that you've seen all that we have to offer in the main menu, let us explore The _IBM Tower of Skills Build Mastery_ by starting a New Game!



== Controls

[TODO] Rewrite introduction section to be better + fill in any gaps missed, like world specific controls + update controls to reflect final version or whatever

This game is designed to be played using either a gamepad, or a keyboard and mouse. While the game should be compatable with most gamepads, it has been designed primarily for the Playstation DualSense‚Ñ¢ Controllers, the Xbox Wireless Controllers and the Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers. As each of these controllers have different layouts, below is a graphic that can be mapped onto any controller, used for our control descriptions (rewrite this), for keyboard controls we will be referencing the keys.

For the controls below, Left/Right Stick Up/Down/Left/Right refers to pushing the Left/Right stick in the specified direction enough for the game to register it as an input. Similarly for D-Pad Up/Down/Left/Right and the other buttons listed, these require pushing the button enough for the game to register this as an input.

== Taking a break

[TODO] Explain how saving works
- Show demo, like having character next to hub world altar, save, then reload, bringing you to hub world spawn

Need a break from the game? Have something unexpecidly occur whilst playing that needs your attention? Worry not because we have added a pause menu! When entering the pause menu you will see a familiar sight; the same background image as the main menu. This is intentional, as the main menu is designed to be a welcoming and relaxing menu. We wanted the user to experience the same in the pause menu, as the pause menu should also be a safe retreat whenever needed whilst playing the game. When in the pause menu, the game is paused, so no need to worry about dying whilst in here.

#table(
  columns: (50%, 50%),
  inset: 10pt,
  align: horizon,
  [*Pause Menu Button*], [*Description*],
  [Resume], [This button resumes the game.],

  [Skills Build], [This button opens a link to the Skills Build website, in case the user would like to review the content there.],

  [Inventory], [This button opens the user's inventory],
  
  [Skip Level], [If the user is struggling in the current level, then pressing this button skips the current level. ],
  
  [Settings], [The settings button opens the settings menu.],

  [Save], [The save button saves the user's progress up to the current level.],
  
  [Save and Quit], [The save and quit button saves the game, then opens the main menu.])

  #figure(
  image("Images/pause_menu.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [Image of Pause Menu including background image and all buttons.],
)

  
  The Settings Menu in the pause menu is the same as in the main menu, containing the same buttons and layout.

  Skipping a level cannot be done in a boss world or in the hub world, meaning that the user must beat the boss of each world to progress. 

  When saving the game, the game does not save progress within the current level, meaning that if the user now decided to close the game after saving, the user would have to redo everything in the current scene. Saving is also not possible during a boss fight.
  


== Worlds

This game is split into multiple "worlds", every world is a collection of levels that represent a different section of IBM Skills Build, each with its own themes and challenges, in addition to the hub world and final world.

The hub world exists to connect each of the worlds together, as well as being a safe location for the player to reside.
Within this area the player can speak to the Spirit of the Altar, who gives the player their mission, opening the gates to the 4 major worlds. 

#figure(
  image("Images/Altar.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [Image of player in front of the Altar],)

As the game progresses, non-player characters (NPCs) will begin to populate this area, giving the player hints and advice, often related to the IBM Skills Build.
[Image of NPCs]

Once the portals have opened in the hub world the player can travel to one of the four worlds:
- The hostile futuristic Artificial Intelligence world.
- The dark cold Data Science world.
- The bright sky islands of the Cloud world
- The threat intelligence world? [fill in]

After completing each world, the player will be rewarded with a [magic maguffin skills build thing] which will be placed on the altar, after collecting all 4 [magic maguffins] a new portal will open to the final boss world.

=== Central hub

=== The other two worlds

The other two worlds are still a work in progress, we have

[TODO] Explain its WIP
- Describe the puzzle specific quirks of these missing worlds
- Show the sprite/texture of these missing worlds

=== Final Boss World

The final world is designed to test everything the player learned from the 4 major worlds, though [combinations of puzzles from all worlds (is this the intention?) (We probably just make it a boss fight with questions from all worlds -NAM- We don't have time for this imo, so just a boss I would say -JOSH-)] and a final combat section utilizing Skills Build Questions from all 4 bosses.
The texture theme of this world is:
