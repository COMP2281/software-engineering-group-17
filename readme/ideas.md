# Ideas 

## Inspiration - Undertale / Deltarune

- The player is an IBM employee and gets transported to a world in his computer
- Everything from his job appears in the world
- His computer is corrupted and needs fixing (he also wants to go back home)
- Make a top down 2D rpg
- Doors block the way forward, players must answer questions to proceed
- Players can find answers to questions through combat and puzzles
- Combat will have the option to “scan enemies” for information to get clues on how to answer questions
- Have puzzles where the layout is basically trying to mix and match items. Can also include Q&A

## Learning Game with Rewards

## Top Down Puzzle RPG

- The player is an IBM employee and gets transported to a world in his computer
- Everything from his job appears in the world
- His computer has a virus and needs to be fixed in order for the employee to go back
- Doors block the way forward, players must answer questions to proceed
  - In order to answer these questions players must find the right answer through puzzles
- Bosses will exist between some puzzles
  - Bosses will be difficult and involve answering questions to damage the boss and avoiding damage by answering questions in quick time events
- Intro scene
  - IBM John welcome you to your new job at IBM SkillsBuild
    - What is John going to wear? Suit, hoodie, shirt, tshirt, jeans, suit, trousers?
