2. ~~How in-depth should the resources linked in the game go into? (If an end user can get the badges in the IBM courses, should they be made to play the game fully, or can they answer the question and quickly get through it?) - Should the game’s sole focus be to help the player answer IBM’s SkillBuild courses, or should the game be enjoyable as well?~~

   - ~~Say we prefer Unity or RPGMaker~~
