  question: Which of the following best describes the difference between AI, Machine
    Learning, and Deep Learning?
  answers:
  - Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, which in turn is a subset of artificial
    intelligence
  - Each level is differentiated by specific algorithms that power the system
  - They are synonyms for the same approach for the field of artificial intelligence
  - Machine Learning is a subset of Deep Learning, which in turn is a subset of artificial
    intelligence
