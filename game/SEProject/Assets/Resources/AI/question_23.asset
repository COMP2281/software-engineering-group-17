  question: Humans have superior data gathering and learning techniques compared
    to machines. In which context could humans use some augmented help?
  answers:
  - All of the others
  - When there is endless relevant newly published data, such that is impossible
    to know all of it at all times
  - When humans try to make in-depth if-then statements in minimum and optimized
    time
  - When there are many variables at play
