  question: What is true about misconfiguration as one of the most challenging types
    of cyber threats?
  answers:
  - All of the others
  - Employees and insiders falling for phishing emails that resulted in account takeover
    or access to sensitive data
  - Incidents where attackers gain access to vulnerable systems left exposed by inexperienced
    administrators or users (e.g., default factory settings)
