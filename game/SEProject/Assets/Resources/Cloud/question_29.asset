  question: What is so special about edge data?
  answers:
  - All of the others
  - It is all the new forms of data generated by us and our devices, tablets, smartphones,
    wearables, sensors and more.
  - It's fast-paced, dynamic, unstructured, temporal in nature unlike any prior data
    creation model
  - Edge data is incredibly rich in understanding context and, therefore, potentially
    has very high value
